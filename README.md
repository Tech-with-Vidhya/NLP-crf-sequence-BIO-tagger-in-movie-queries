# NLP-crf-sequence-BIO-tagger-in-movie-queries
This project is delivered as part of my Masters in Big Data Science (MSc BDS) Program for the module named “Natural Language Processing” in Queen Mary University of London (QMUL), London, United Kingdom.  This project covers the implementation of the Conditional Random Field (CRF) sequence tagger for the movie trivia questions and answers private dataset with BIO (Beginning, Inside, Outside) tagging format.  **NOTE:** Due to the data privacy and the data protection policy to be adhered by the students; the datasets and the solution related code are not exposed and updated in the GitHub public profile; in order to be compliant with the Queen Mary University of London (QMUL) policies.
